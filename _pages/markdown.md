## Our research areas
1. Development of quantitative sequencing technologies for various novel mRNA chemical modifications.

2. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of RNA modifications (such as m6Am, Î¨) in physiological states and disease progression.

3. Investigation of biological regulatory functions of non-coding RNAs (such as tRNA).
