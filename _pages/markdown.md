## Our research areas
Development of quantitative sequencing technologies for various novel mRNA chemical modifications.
Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of RNA modifications (such as m6Am, Î¨) in physiological states and disease progression.
Investigation of biological regulatory functions of non-coding RNAs (such as tRNA).

We are actively recruiting postdoctoral fellows, Ph.D. and master's students. Talented young researchers with strong interest in our research areas are welcome to join our team.
